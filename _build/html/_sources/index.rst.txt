PyDataDC Recommender System Workshop
=====================================

The recommendation system is a classic application of machine learning that aims to predict which item a user will like best. Personalized recommendations play an integral role for e-commerce platforms, with the goal of driving user engagement through item recommendations.

In this workshop, we will build a recommendation system using data from the `MovieLens dataset <https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/>`_. We will also cover the following topics on recommendations:

- collaborative vs. content-based filtering
- implicit vs. explicit feedback
- handling the cold start problem
- recommendation model evaluation

By the end of this workshop, you will have a better understanding of the different techniques and tools used to build recommendation systems in real-life scenarios.
